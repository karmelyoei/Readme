#### Before I get started to give you the ten steps for a better Readme, You should put these points in your mind :

#### 1. Readme quality varies.

#### 2. There are a few conventions.

#### 3. Readme is missing information.

#### So you don't need to worry about how perfect is the readme or about breaking reader expectations.

#### one more thing, not all the developers write a readme or mention at least their project's name so don't panic if you forget about not doing the readme at the beginning, you can do it later after you finish your project.

# So lets get started! :metal:

 **Ten steps for a better Readme**

## 1. Identify the project

- Make sure the project's name is the first heading or plain text.

- Add a URL for the project.

- Add the software's need/solution.

- Identify the owner or author of the project

## 2. Evaluate the project

This is the hardest part of writing a README.cause it's describe the project in terms of what the project does or achieves. :dart:

## 3. Build Software

How to use the project and what steps need to run your code-How to install it
Help the reader go from having your project's files to using the project for the first time.

try to list the project's prerequisites like :

- Hardware
- Operating System
- Libraries

## 4. Is Software ready?

Be honest and let the reader knows if it's ready or not and why.
you don't want the reader or the user to feel disappointed if he reached the point where the software is not working, besides this will help you to attract other professional developers who might help you with the code if it's not working.

## 5. Tips and Tricks

You can descripe some parts of the code for the reader using some code smaples.

Dont forget: :ng_woman::ng_woman:

1. The problems are you solving.
2. Important points should be at the top.
3. Sub points in bullets.

## 4. TroubelShoting

- FAQ
- Bugs

## 7. Contributions

Community of users or developers,and explain how they can engage with the project.

## 8. Licensing and Credits

Top-level README companion files one of them is LICENSE.

Describe who may use the project and under what terms. you can read more info here [Licensing a repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository)

## 9. List of Changes

Who hates the upgrades? Me :joy: :joy:

<br>

## 10. How long is my Readme?

If your README is very long, move content to other documents.
and Set a reminder to review your README after few weeks
